**Abstract:**
\
Infestations of trees by woody climbing plants (i.e., lianas) are common and increasing in an estimated 250 Mha of the 1 billion hectares of mixed-species tropical and temperate forest subjected to selective logging. Cutting lianas that impede the growth of future crop trees (FCTs) in these forests would sequester carbon at low cost and increase timber yields. We estimate that over 30 years if this treatment were applied to five liana-infested FCTs per hectare across the 250 Mha of selectively logged forest would result in 0.8 PgCO2 of additional carbon removals by the liberated trees at a direct cost of well less than $1.00 MgCO2-1. The same treatment could also be applied in forests not destined for logging where liana infestations were exacerbated by prior anthropogenic disturbances. If the numbers of trees liberated from lianas is kept small, undesired impacts on biodiversity will be minimized.
